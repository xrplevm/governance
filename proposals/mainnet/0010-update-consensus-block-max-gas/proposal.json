    "summary": "During the genesis phase of mainnet deployments, the consensus parameters were not properly set. As a result, the provided configuration was overridden by default values from CometBFT. We propose to cap the block.max_gas value to 21,000,000, which approximates the gas required for ~1,000 typical Ethereum transactions.",
