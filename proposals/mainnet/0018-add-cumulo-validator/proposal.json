    "summary": "Cumulo is a professional PoS validator and blockchain infrastructure provider operating production infrastructure across 10+ networks, from early testnets to mainnet. We run validators, different type of nodes, monitoring systems, dashboards, and custom-built tooling across modular, EVM, Cosmos-SDK, and emerging L1 ecosystems. As a community partner, we develop technical tools, publish validator guides, and organize events and hackathons to strengthen ecosystems and support long-term sustainability. Cumulo works closely with protocol teams, foundations, builders, and communities to ensure infrastructure is not just running—but understood, accessible, and aligned with the network’s growth."
