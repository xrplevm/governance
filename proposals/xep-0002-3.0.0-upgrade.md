# Devnet upgrade to v3.0.0

## Description

Upgrade the current devnet to the [v3.0.0](https://github.com/xrplevm/node/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

## Motivation

With the upcoming Axelar integration, there is a need to pair ERC20 tokens to Cosmos tokens in order to provide a seamless experience for users. 
This upgrade introduces an upgrade of the `evmos` dependency to `v19` as well as the new `erc20` module from the [evmOS](https://github.com/evmos/os) stack.
