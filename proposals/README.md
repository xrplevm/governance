# Proposals

## XRPL EVM Sidechain Governance Introduction

Welcome to the Proposals section of the XRPL EVM Sidechain Governance Repository. This section is dedicated to documenting all governance proposals that have been submitted for voting on the XRPL EVM Sidechain. The goal is to ensure transparency and to facilitate the community's participation in the decision-making processes that shape the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

## Proposal Process

The proposal process consists of several steps to ensure thorough discussion, review, and implementation of each proposal. The steps are outlined below:

### Start a Discussion & Gather Feedback

1. **Initiate a Discussion**: Before submitting a formal proposal, initiate a discussion with the community. This can be done by starting a [Discussion](https://github.com/xrplevm/governance/discussions) in the repository.

2. **Gather Feedback**: Use this platform to gather input, suggestions, and feedback from other community members. This step is crucial for refining your proposal and ensuring that it addresses community needs and concerns.

3. **Discussion Title**: The title of the discussion should follow the format `XEP-{0000} {Title}`, where `{0000}` is a unique number for the proposal and `{Title}` is a descriptive title.

### Close the Discussion and Submit a PR

1. **Finalize the Discussion**: Once the discussion has matured and you have gathered sufficient feedback, announce the closure of the discussion by posting a comment. Allow a few days for final input.

2. **Submit a Pull Request**: After closing the discussion, draft your proposal following the provided [proposal-template.md](./proposal-template.md). Create a new markdown file in the `/proposals` directory using a descriptive filename. Submit a pull request (PR) with your proposal file.

3. **Review and Acceptance**: The maintainers will review your PR for style conformance and applicability. Once reviewed, the maintainers will accept your PR.

### Create an On-Chain Proposal

1. **On-Chain Proposal**: After your PR is accepted, proceed to create an on-chain proposal using the [Cosmos SDK x/gov module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/gov).

2. **Status Update**: Update the proposal file in the repository with the new status and include the on-chain proposal ID. This ensures that all stakeholders can track the proposal's progress from discussion to implementation.
