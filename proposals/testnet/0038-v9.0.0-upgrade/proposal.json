  "summary": "The XRPL EVM sidechain chain upgrade v9.0.0 is ready to migrate Evmos—an unmaintained dependency—to Cosmos EVM v0.4.1, a fully supported fork of Evmos.\nThis is more than just a technical upgrade. By moving to Cosmos EVM, the XRPL EVM ecosystem gains:\n - Long-term sustainability: Evmos had become unsupported, leaving chains that depended on it without a clear upgrade path. Cosmos EVM is actively maintained, ensuring compatibility with the broader Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems.\n - Future-proof development: Cosmos EVM continuously integrates Ethereum standards (EIPs) and protocol upgrades. This ensures that XRPL EVM applications remain interoperable with Ethereum tooling.\n - Extended functionality: The migration introduces new ERC-20 capabilities such as mint, burn, and ownership transfer—giving developers and token projects more flexibility.\n - Alignment with the Cosmos ecosystem: By standardizing on Cosmos EVM, XRPL EVM can more easily integrate with other Cosmos SDK chains, IBC modules, and upcoming interoperability upgrades. \n\n Read more here: https://x.com/Peersyst/status/1971139829145514317"
