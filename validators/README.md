# XRPL EVM Sidechain validators

The EVM sidechain uses the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm. A set of validators will confirm blocks on the EVM sidechain. New validators can join, or current validators can be updated or removed based on voting by the existing set of validators. Each validator is a well known and reputed member of the XRPL community which has direct incentives to behave properly.
