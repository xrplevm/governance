# XRPL EVM Sidechain Governance 

Welcome to the XRPL EVM Sidechain Governance. This repository is designed to provide transparency and enable everyone to track and participate in the governance activities of the XRPL EVM Sidechain, a Cosmos SDK-based chain that brings EVM compatibility to the XRP Ledger.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main sections: Proposals, Standards, and Validators. Each section serves a unique purpose in the governance of the XRPL EVM Sidechain.

### [Proposals](./proposals)

The Proposals section contains all the chain voting proposals. Here, you can find detailed information about each proposal, including its status, description, and the outcome of the voting process. This section is essential for keeping track of the decision-making processes and understanding the governance dynamics of the chain.

### [Standards](./standards)

The Standards section is a place where community members can create and discuss new standards and core changes for the chain. This is similar to the XRPL-Standards repository, where proposals for improvements and new features are reviewed and discussed by the community.


### [Validators](./validators)

The Validators section is designed to keep track of the current validators on the XRPL EVM Sidechain. Validators play a crucial role in the consensus mechanism and overall security of the blockchain. This section provides information about each validator, including their status and contributions to the network.

## Contributing

Community contributions are highly encouraged. Whether you are proposing a new standard, submitting a governance proposal, or updating validator information, your participation is valuable.

Please adhere to the contribution guidelines specified in each section. Should you have any questions or require assistance, do not hesitate to open an issue or contact the repository maintainers.
